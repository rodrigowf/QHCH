### *Formulated by Rodrigo Werneck Franco, expanded with insights from quantum mechanics, neuroscience, general relativity, and philosophy of mind.*

## **1. Fundamental Axiom: Superposition = The Physically Real Perception**

1. **Superposition \\(\\neq\\) Potentialities**  
   In QHPH, the wavefunction of a neural system (e.g., microtubules in the brain) isn't a set of un-chosen classical states. It is **one single physically real arrangement** that the system "lives" as *the direct, continuous, holographic experience.*  
2. **Continuous 'Holographic' Field**  
   This wavefunction's amplitude and phase encode everything about the perceived reality. If we expand to multiple microtubules or brain regions, they unify into **one** wavefunction describing the entire integrated field.

**Mathematically**:  
Let \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) be the Hilbert space of the neural quantum system. A **superposition** is

\\[
|\\Psi_{\\!Q}\\rangle \\;=\\; \\sum_{i} c_i \\,|\\psi_i\\rangle,
\\]
with \\(\\sum_i |c_i|^2 = 1\\). Instead of enumerating classical "options," QHPH states \\(\\lvert \\Psi_{\\!Q}\\rangle\\) *is* the physically real, currently felt arrangement.

Addendum: Hermetic and Hindu Principles within the QHPH Framework
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. Introduction to the Universal Consciousness Field  
In both Hermetic and Hindu traditions, reality is understood as arising from a universal Consciousness—a premise central to the Quantum Holographic Perception Hypothesis (QHPH). Hermetically, "The All is Mind," and in Hindu thought, "Brahman is Consciousness." QHPH affirms this by placing consciousness at the very foundation of reality: the *quantum holographic field* is not a byproduct of neural processes but an irreducible constant of existence.  

2. Microcosm–Macrocosm Resonance: "As Above, So Below" and "Atman = Brahman"  
• Hermetic teaching states: "As above, so below; as within, so without."  
• Hindu wisdom proclaims: "The Atman (individual soul) is one with Brahman (universal spirit)."  
QHPH mirrors these insights through the unifying principle of quantum entanglement, showing how localized holographic states (the microcosm) remain implicitly connected to the broader, universal wavefunction (the macrocosm), thus reflecting fractal self-similarity across all scales of being.
